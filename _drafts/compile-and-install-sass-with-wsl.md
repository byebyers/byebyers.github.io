I love using SASS because it allows me to break up my CSS and use variables when I need to simplify changes. Whether it be stylistic theme components or web page specific design I find this tool to be essential! It saves time and helps me navigate my CSS when it becomes a monster over the course of development. I highly recommend using SASS for your projects.
