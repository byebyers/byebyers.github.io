### What are tags?

Essentially they are important bits of information to give to the browser like page title, description, and images. Yet they go a step further by getting important tracking information to the web owner. For example, you may be familiar with Google Analytics. So if you want to use 3rd party tags you would have to add them to your website.

There are a few issues to this whether it be needing a developer or figuring it out yourself. On top of that, the more tags added that link outside of your site may affect your site's performance. In comes Google Tag Manager.

With this service, tags are made for you. Plus you get a nice admin panel to keep your marketing and analytics tools in one place. All you have to do is have their code snippets on your site. That way there are a few links instead of many which improve performance and you can add them without the need of a developer. 

### Setting up Google Tag Manager

1. Go to [Google Tag Manager]() to access. If you already have a Gmail account associated with yourself or your company then click "Create Account". If you don't have one then click "Sign Up For Free" to get started.
2. Next, youâ€™ll be given code snippets and instructions to include one line of code at the top of the <head> tag on your page, and then other after the opening <body> tag. Once you add these code snippets to your website, make sure it is saved and loaded to the host.

Once you complete this set up you will want to set up your first tag. We will use Google Analytics to get started. Make sure to that you have an account first before you start this.

> Tip: Google Recommends the following naming convention for tags

> tag type - name of app - detail.

 1. Create a new tag in Dashboard by clicking "Add New Tag"

10. Finally you will be taken to the Version Summary page and are finished. Give it some time before checking Google Analytics to see if it works.
